## Problem Solving Skill Syntax in Python

When approaching a problem in Python, following a clear step-by-step process helps build strong logic and clean code. Here is a simple syntax template to guide your problem-solving approach:

### 1. Understand the Problem

- 👀 Read the problem carefully.  
- 📥 Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints.

### 2. Plan the Solution

- 🧩 Break down the problem into smaller steps.  
- 🔧 Decide which programming constructs (loops, conditionals, functions) to use.

### 3. Write Pseudocode (Optional but helpful)
